## What is a Candle Chart?

A candle chart is a type of financial chart that uses candlesticks to
represent price movements. Each candlestick represents a specific period
of time, such as one minute, five minutes, or one hour. The candlestick
consists of a body and two wicks or shadows.

## How to Use the Candle Strategy

The candle strategy involves analyzing the patterns of candlesticks to
identify trading opportunities. There are many different candlestick
patterns, each with its own unique meaning. Some of the most common
candlestick patterns include:

-   Bullish patterns: These patterns indicate that the price is likely
    to rise, including the Hammer, Piercing Line, Bullish Engulfing,
    Morning Star, and Three White Soldiers.
-   Bearish patterns: These patterns indicate that the price is likely
    to fall, including the Hanging Man, Shooting Star, Bearish
    Engulfing, Evening Star, and Three Black Crows.
-   Continuation patterns: These patterns indicate that the current
    trend is likely to continue, including the Doji, Spinning Top,
    Falling Three Methods, and Rising Three Methods.
